    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is how I like to make borscht for my family. It is very thick and satisfying on a cold winter night. Many people who are scared of beets enjoy my borscht because it has so many other flavors. For best flavor, top each bowl of borscht with a tablespoon of sour cream.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef soup bones</li>
        <li>2 quarts water</li>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>3 celery ribs, sliced</li>
        <li>3 beets, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

Add potatoes, carrots, celery, beets, onion, garlic, salt, paprika, and ground black pepper to the broth. Bring broth again to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour more.</li>
        <li>Pick meat off soup bones and add back to soup. Discard bones and fat. Stir cabbage, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste into the soup. Continue cooking at a simmer until the cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes.s</li>
