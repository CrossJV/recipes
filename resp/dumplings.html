    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These colorful Korean dumplings are fall in a pocket. Vibrant-hued juice lends color to the skins, and veggies and tofu pack a nutritional punch.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cellophane noodles</li>
        <li>4 cups chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped scallions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and dice.</li>
        <li>Place cabbage, onion, bell pepper, carrot, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until vegetables are diced.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Saute the vegetable mixture in the hot oil, stirring frequently, until soft, about 6 minutes. Add tofu; saute for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place filling in a cheesecloth and squeeze as much water out as possible. Transfer the filling to a bowl and mix in the diced noodles, scallions, and sesame oil until well combined.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, beet juice, egg, and salt for dough together in a bowl and knead until cohesive but not sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough with a thin rolling pin, or roll it through your pasta machine at the thickest setting. Progressively roll the dough thinner until it reaches the second-thinnest setting on your machine--or, thin enough that it's see-through, but not quite transparent. Cut circles for dumpling wrappers with a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or cup. Roll excess dough back through the machine, or with a rolling pin, repeating the process and cutting out more wrappers until you have no more dough left.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons of filling in the center of each dumpling wrapper. Fold each wrapper in half and pinch all the way across until the dumpling is sealed firmly shut.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Working in batches, add dumplings, cover, and steam until heated through, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
